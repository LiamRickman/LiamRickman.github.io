                    <p><span style="font-style: italic">FPS Prototype</span> is a mechanic design project where I created a player controller for a first-person shooter. I was inspired by unique movement from games like Titanfall 2 and Deep Rock Galactic and wanted to learn how I could implement such mechanics in my own games.
                        <br><br>I focused on rapid prototyping and wanted to get as many iterations as possible so I could experiment with different versions of my main mechanics. I conducted playtests and gathered feedback from peers and friends to improve the mechanics.
                        <br><br>I started with a first-person controller and then focused on two movement mechanics. A grappling hook that moves the player towards the grapple point, and a shotgun jump which blasts the player backwards from where they are looking.

                    <p>This was the first iteration of the prototype with both shotgun jump and grappling hook mechanics implemented.
                        <br><br>There were some issues with the grappling hook where the player could be launched out of the map and occasionally get stuck to walls unintentionally.
                        <br><br>I also had issues with air movement whilst using the shotgun jump, which was disabled for later improvements.

                    <p>A new test level was created to better test the movement mechanics. 
                        <br><br>I also added two new weapons to give players options when attacking enemies (To be added later)
                        <br><br>In this version, the shotgun jump was quite strong and allowed players to "fly" if used correctly.

                    <p>I created a new gameplay demo level which would show off the movement and FPS mechanics in a more interesting way. This includes enemies to defeat with a kill counter to track these.
                        <br><br>The grapple was also improved to allow players to "stick" to walls and look around. This gives players more time to pick their next move after grappling to a wall.
                        <br><br>I also adjusted shotgun power and grapple range to tone down movement relative to the new demo level.

                    <p>Various quality of life improvements were added including a jump buffer to make it easier to jump off ledges and fixing some player movement issues where they would bounce around.
                        <br><br>Players can also only reload the shotgun while grounded, making it more skill based when moving around the level and stopping players "flying" through the level.
                        <br><br>After testing, players were not a fan of this shotgun change and it was reworked for the final version.
