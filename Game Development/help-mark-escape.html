                    <p><span style="font-style: italic">Help Mark Escape</span> is a 3D visual novel prototype developed by a student led team in collaboration with Embodied Self Defence.
                        <br><br>The game aims to educate young people about the potentially dangerous scenarios they may encounter in life. It teaches them how to identify red flags in these situations and how they can best approach and defend themselves from them.
                        <br><br>We worked with our client Embodied, who specialise in teaching self-defence. They provided the initial brief and intended gameplay experience, which we then adapted into a prototype for them to use for obtaining further funding and development.
                        <br><br>My role as Lead Designer involved me designing content such as mechanics, adjusting narrative, and level design. Later on in development, I helped the programmers implement these features in Unreal Engine.

                    <p>To make the visual novel more engaging, I designed different interactions so the player can move around the environment and progress the story. Interactions are outlined to help stand out to the player.
                        <br><br>Interactions are split into Dialogue, Object, and Location. Dialogue allows the player to talk to other characters in-game. This is usually to progress the story or learn more about a character.
                        <br><br>Object interactions allow players to explore their setting, potentially getting hints about the characters or environment.
                        <br><br>Finally location interactions let the player explore the environment at their own pace. These are usually used on doors to move between rooms and scenes.

                    <p>The dialogue is the primary gameplay mechanic as a visual novel. It allows players to progress the story and learn more about the scenario shown.
                        <br><br>We felt it was important to give players some choice in their dialogue options as otherwise it would just involve reading and no real decision making.
                        <br><br>This allowed us to use branching paths for the narrative, so after I restructured parts of the narrative we used some dialogue options to branch out and alter the outcome of the story.
                        <br><br>For our dialogue choices, we ensured there was a minimum of two choices for the player at any point to always give them a choice in how the story pans out.

                <p>Initial level designs were created by the environment artists working on the art for those levels. However after first implementing these in engine we realised there were some issues with our intended mechanics and gameplay using these layouts.
                <br><br>Primarily there were issues with size and layout, some rooms felt empty and others didn't work with our side scrolling movement. To fix this, I researched different level design techniques and took inspiration from real life examples of the types of levels we were creating.
                <br><br>I then remade the layouts built around our movement mechanics and intended gameplay, indicated by the blue arrows in each picture.
